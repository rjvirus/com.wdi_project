# com.wdi_project
The objective of the project is to integrate multiple datasets into one schema in order to capture all the
important attributes of players. The phases that the project went through were in order - Data Extraction
and Translation, Schema Mapping, and Data Fusion. The integrated dataset will help analyze if a player is
worth transferring and in case of a transfer it will contain important details about the transfer (contract
expiration date, agent, sponsor, etc.)
